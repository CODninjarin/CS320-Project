How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

    The simple answer would be testing, but ensuring code is functional and secure starts before it's even ready to be tested. Using best practices and proofreading code as it's created can help lead to less issues further down the line. Manually ensuring all requirements are present, working through algorithms to ensure the logic is correct, and then finally testing the functionality of the code all tie together to ensure it works    properly. If you skip the first two steps and go straight into testing it can lead to mistakes going unnoticed. In my original version of the included files the Delete function within ContactService did not work     properly, though it passed the tests I utilized. In later sections, after taking in feedback and utilizing more tests, I realized the algorithm had a flaw in it and was able to replace the mistake. While this was an     issue with the tests used, it was also something that could've been avoided if I manually tested my algorithm better.
    
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

    User needs and requirements are meant to guide the direction of the program and set parameters. They don't always dicatate how code should be written, but typically tell the developer what variables should be present and what functions must be included. Using the Included files as an example, the requirments gave instructions for what variables to include in the Contact file as well as their limitations, such as not being Null, setting length limits, and the ID needing to be unchangable. This let me know that these variables needed to be included and checked to make sure they meet those specifications. These requirements also guided my testing to ensure that not only was the code functional, but it also met theses requirements. 
    
How do I approach designing software?

    My typical approuch for designing software involves identifying the requirements and then working through the logic. This process is still something that I am learning to be better at, and this project definitely pointed out the importance of planning and paying attention to details.
